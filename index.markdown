title: Working Group "ViVaT" (Visualizing Variation in Text")
---

# Who we are
The Working Group **V**i**V**a**T** brings together an international group of scholars who study variation in literary and historical documents. In particular, the working group addresses the challenge of using visualizations to    represent textual differences and make the output of collation software more informative for a wider audience.

Check out the About-page for more background and information about our work and how you can join!
